# train-puzzle
the two trains on the track are running the same codebase, try to get them to collide using only these 4 commands: MVL (move left), MVR (move right), STS (skip instruction if at the station), and JMP (jump to another line in the code)

the box in the middle is for your code
the green box runs your code
the red box resets and clears
Good luck!
